# Pomodoro Study Timer

A virtual Pomodoro study timer utilizing the Pomodoro Technique. 

## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro study techinque is a method of studying that utilizes a series of timed sprints followed by short breaks. During each sprint a user tackles one item on their checklist. They dedicate the entire 25 minute sprint to a distraction free studying of that topic. After this 25 minute sprint the user takes a 3 to 4 minute break and repeats the cycle but on the next item in their "to-do" list. Once a user completes 4 sprints (4 checklist items) they have completed one Pomodoro. Each Pomodoro is followed by a longer break.
